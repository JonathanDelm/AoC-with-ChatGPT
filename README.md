# Advent of Code with ChatGPT 2022

In this project I'll try to use [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) to solve the 2022 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) puzzles.

The goal is to make ChatGPT come to the right solution without manually touching the code by guiding it to the right changes to make. I will however be using my knowledge as a programmer to sometimes give specific hints on how to solve any issues with his code. It's not a test to see if ChatGPT can solve these puzzles without any hints/human input, it's meant to see how adaptable it can be and how useful it would be as a pair program partner.

This way I can learn more about how ChatGPT operates, what the best methodolgy is to use it, how to finetune my prompts, and to get a scope of its capabilities.

## Structure

The project contains a folder for every challenge. Each folder contains subfolders for every attempt if it took more than one attempt with:

- A **conversation.md** file, which contains the conversation between me and ChatGPT.
- A **conversation_screenshot.png** file, which contains a screenshot of the conversation.
- Some amount of **attempt_*.py** files, which contain the code generated by ChatGPT in each iteration.
- An **input.txt** file, which contains the input for the challenge.

## Results

### Day 1
 - *Attempt 1*: Was going well, but session expired and lost the conversation 🤦‍♂️.
 - *Attempt 2*: Solved in **3 attempts** but forgot about the second part of the puzzle 🤦‍♂️.
 - *Attempt 3*: Solved the first part in **3 attempts** and the second part in just **1 attempt**.

Notes:
- So impressive. Makes me wonder if the model is somehow training on the input from other people who also make it solve the same AoC challenges. Or there is some other kind of 'data leakage' for these specific challenges.

### Day 2
Solved first part in **3 attempts** and second part in **2 attempts**.

Notes:
- Most of the time for part 1 was spent by me debugging the almost perfect code. Should probably try to reproduce and try to debug via ChatGPT (but that's more overhead in the copy pasting of code).
- The biggest challenge of part 2 was keeping the code short enough so it didn't get cut off. Also, removing comments from the code is apparently not trivial for some reason.
- I had a lot more attempts for part 2 but none of the other ones were fully printed, so I only include those that are full pieces of code as attempt.

### Day 3
Solved both parts in **2 attempts**.

Notes:
- A very minor mistake in both parts, easily fixed by ChatGPT with simple instructions. Amazing.
- Output like this after being corrected makes it almost feel *too* human-like:
    > I mistakenly assumed that duplicates would be eliminated because the puzzle states that "the Elves have made a list of all of the items currently in each rucksack," which implies that each item is only counted once. However, upon rereading the puzzle description, I see that I was incorrect.


## Notes

- Sometimes, presumably when ChatGPT's answers are too long, he just stops. If this happens I need to urge him to shorten his answer. I do not count these prompts as attempts.
