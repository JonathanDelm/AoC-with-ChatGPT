## Prompt
We did not succeed in solving the puzzle. Summarize this conversation. It will be used to record how well ChatGPT performed on the tasks. Why weren't we able to solve the puzzle? What went wrong? How could I have improved my prompts? What would have made the input parsing easier?

# Response
In this conversation, we attempted to solve the puzzle from the 2022 Advent of Code called "Supply Stacks", but we were unable to solve the puzzle. The main issue was that the initial code for parsing the input file was not correct, and it did not correctly extract the information needed to solve the puzzle.

We were able to determine the correct number of stacks and the correct maximum height of the stacks in the input file, but we were not able to parse the initial stack configuration correctly. The main issue with the initial code was that it did not use the i variable to index the correct portion of each line that represents a stack of crates.

To improve the prompts, it would have been helpful to provide a more detailed explanation of the input format, and to include an example input file that includes more than three stacks and more than three moves. This would have made it easier to understand the input format, and to write code that can parse the input file correctly.

To make the input parsing easier, it would have been helpful to include a description of the expected output format, and to provide examples of valid and invalid input files. This would have made it clearer what the code should do, and it would have made it easier to test the code and verify that it works correctly.
