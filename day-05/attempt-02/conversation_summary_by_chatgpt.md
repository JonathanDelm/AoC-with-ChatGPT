# Response
In this conversation, the user was trying to solve the second part of the Advent of Code "Supply Stacks" puzzle, which involves rearranging crates on multiple stacks using a CraneMover 9001 that can move multiple crates at once and preserve their order. The user had already solved the first part of the puzzle, but was unsure how to adapt the solution to work for the second part.

I provided several suggestions for updating the rearrange() function to support moving multiple crates at once and preserving their order. I also identified and addressed a few mistakes in the initial solution, such as removing spaces from the stacks and taking the crates from the start of the source stack instead of the end.

Overall, ChatGPT performed well in this conversation, providing detailed and accurate suggestions for solving the puzzle. The mistakes made were minor and were easily corrected.
